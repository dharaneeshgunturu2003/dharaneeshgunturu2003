# 💫 About Me:
I'm **G. Dharaneesh**, currently working as an **SDET Operations Intern (Level 1)** at **Frugal Testing**, Hyderabad. I specialize in **Python, Java**, and the **MERN stack**, with a growing focus on **MLOps** and scalable AI systems.

At Frugal Testing, I’m actively involved in building and managing **end-to-end ML pipelines**, deploying **Computer Vision models**, and contributing to **LLM training and deployment workflows**. I work closely with the MLOps team to integrate model training, evaluation, and deployment into a **production-grade continuous delivery setup** using tools like **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Kubeflow**, and **MLflow**.

With a strong foundation in both **software engineering** and **AI infrastructure**, I bridge the gap between **DevOps and Data Science**, focusing on **model lifecycle management**, **synthetic data generation**, and **pipeline reliability**. I'm also passionate about automation, open-source tools, and using AI to solve real-world problems.

In my free time, you'll find me diving into the latest in **MLOps**, participating in **hackathons**, or sharpening my skills in **online coding contests**.
